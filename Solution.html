						<h1>Solution</h1>
						<p>After collecting all of the research, I was asked to determine the primary call-to-action of the home page and create a style tile.</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Call to Action</h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-03-22 at 3.37.38 AM.png" alt=""/></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>The objectives for my CTAâ€™s are to make it possible for the audience to want to click on buttons that entice their attention. My CTA's revolve around the three main actions that target three different user audiences- travelers, donators, and experienced travelers or scientists. These buttons are ranked in a hierarchy from most desirable actions to least. As a result, I have made the primary CTA a button that will navigate to a page that allows you to find/start your trip. It is in bright green with a dark blue type color to gain the most attention. This is designed for travelers. I have also made a secondary button that is in a darker green with a white type color to attract the second most attention. This button navigates to a page that will show you the team and how to join. This button is targeted at experienced travelers or scientists. The third button is in white with a light blue type color which allows you to navigate to a site where you can donate. This is designed specifically for donators. I have attached above some examples of my call to action buttons.

						<h2>Style Tile</h2>
						<p>We were asked to create a style tile, which is a complation of many different design elements of a webpage, that includes typefaces, CTA buttons, and color choices.</p>
					</header>
					<h2></h2>
					<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="12u$"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-03-22 at 3.15.18 AM.png" alt=""/></span></div>
						<div class="4u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2021-02-28 at 7.44.33 PM.png" alt=""/></span></div>
						<div class="12u$"><p>My style tile is centered around the adjectives- trustworthy, exotic, genuine, adventurous, engaging, and organized. The goal was to create a website and logo that would become a recognizable symbol. Google was my primary inspiration. I chose to use the Dunbar typeface because of it's variety and consistency. I also chose to use orange, yellow-green, blue-green, yellow, and grey-white to create a color scheme that was subtle and standard while still alludng to the exotic, adventurous vibe of the agency. The logo is a world with three different types of trees representing each continent that the agency travels to- Africa, Australia and the surrounding islands, and South America. The textures are different wildlife settings that the travelers would experience, and the CTA buttons are in a variety of colors that reflect the color scheme.
