						<h1>Research</h1>
						<p>I conducted research on Fronteering.com, which includes primary research of the website and company itself, secondary research, and interviews of audience members.</p>

					<h2>Primary Client Research</h2>
					<p>Fronteering Travel Agency has a social media presence on twitter, instagram, and facebook. Their logo appears to be a watercolor world with the words, "Fronteering, more real, more raw". This specific logo is used throughout all social media and it is overused. There appears to be no ad content or documentation other than on the actual website. Included below are screenshots of the sections of the website, facebook, logos, twitter, instagram, and reviews on a travel website.

					<h1>User Interviews</h1>
					<p class="info">I have cut the below interviews down to a few questions each to touch on the most important points.</p>
				</header>
				<p> In the first interview, I interviewed Emily McKinney, an education major at Anderson University that is interested in pursuing travel at a future point in her life. She is particularly interested in volunteering and working with communities. Her goals fit perfectly with the resolution of Fronteering.com. 
					
				Emily said that she would have found this website when looking for different travel opportunities, especially those involving volunteer opportunities. She is most drawn to the volunteer opportunities listed, especially the animal wildlife conservation. “It’s really awesome to see that they’re putting an interest in helping out wildlife and it’s just an awesome opportunity.”		
				</p>
				<p>What most stands out stands out to you as something that can be improved about the website?

					 “It seems a little bit confusing. I’m not immediately drawn to the logo- the colors are a little bit dull. If it was more designated towards the audience which is younger people, it should have more bright coloring and more excitement, as well as in the articles themselves and organization.”
				</p>
				<p>Based on the website, would you ever pursue Fronteering.com as an agency to volunteer around the world?

					“Based off of the website currently, not so much. I think that with new additions, and again with more excitement and more colors and vibrancy with the website I think that I would definitely be more interested. I think it has good content, it just needs better presentation.”
					</p>
				<p>If you were to compare this website to other travel agency website options, would this be your first choice based on the website alone?

					“Based on this [website], I do think that there would be better ones. It would not be the first one that I’m drawn to. I definitely think that it has potential to be better.” 
				   </p>
				<p>I asked, what would be the top three things that you would be looking for in a travel agency’s website?

					“There’s nothing that expresses what they’re currently working on. There’s nothing about where the goal is. Another thing is just having more articles. I would like to hear other peoples experiences and other things that they’re working on, but the travel blog doesn’t have much information. Also showing more pictures and adventures of the areas where they’re volunteering would help give me a perspective of what it would look like to volunteer with them.” 
				 </p>

				 <h4>Notes for what needs to be fixed</h4>
					<ul class="alt">
						<li>Dull Colors</li>
						<li>Confusing Layout</li>
						<li>Better Logo</li>
						<li>More Vibrancy</li>
						<li>Better Presentation</li>
						<li>More Competetive</li>
						<li>Clear goal</li>
						<li>More articles</li>
						<li>More Pictures</li>
					</ul>

				<p>
					In the second interview, I interviewed Emma McNamara who is a graphic designer at Anderson University. Emma has already done some extensive traveling and will be traveling to France this summer.
				</p>
				<p>
					What are your first thoughts? 

					“My first thought is that it doesn't look like a travel site. It looks more like an environmental information site. I’d also say that the logo is very confusing. It’s kind of off putting to me and doesn’t seem very professional. At the same time, I’m not overwhelmed or confused. I can find everything that I need right here. There’s not too much going on. Some of the buttons are confusing, but the watercolor section where you type your name in in the comments is kind of fun! I went to the Scotland page because that seemed interesting, but the photos aren’t really showing pictures of Scotland and it’s confusing, so it looks like they need better pictures. The information is very clear though so that’s good." 
				</p>
				<p>“What is something that you think is missing from the website that could be added to help it be more effective?

					“I think a section about who is behind this and why. Usually I would expect something like this from this type of website so I can get to know the people behind. And also I would like to see things like ratings and reviews. I think the pricing on the first page is reasonable, but when you go to the next page it’s there pretty clearly so that’s good. The body copy font looks kind of weird in some places because the header font is so dramatic.”
					
				</p>

						<li>Make it look like a travel website</li>
						<li>Change logo</li>
						<li>Change Buttons</li>
						<li>Update Photos</li>
