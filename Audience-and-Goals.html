					<h3>Goals Conclusions</h3>
					<p>As mentioned before the primary overarching goals of the GCCH is to eradicate homelessness through coordination of services, advocating policy change, and raising awareness and education of homelessness. The audience's goals are to access these services as well as to volunteer, sponsor the coalition, and donate. The website being the vehicle for these services online seeks to make education accessible, provide an outlet for coordinating services, and accrue members. I used my research of the website, the member org. website, and my audience exercise to determine these goals</p>

					<p>The specific goals and content are based on my interview with Dr. Mussman as well as the content that is currently on the GCCH website. The current GCCH website is in no short of content, if anything it has too much. The main work will be learning how to organize the information on the redesigned site so that it is clear and useful.</p>

					<p>Since I completed this assignment before my interviews, I adjusted a couple things so that the goals would portray the true goals of the coalition. I managed to assume correctly that schools, students, and churches were the coalitions top audiences. However, I had to change the content to consider that the coalition does not offer volunteering. So there still will be a volunteering tab but it will instead give info on how to work through the coalition in order to contribute. This new version of my goals also has more specified information. For example, I specified that if someone in the audience wants to sponsor then they would sponsor a shantytown or an edition of the Streetvibes paper.</p>
